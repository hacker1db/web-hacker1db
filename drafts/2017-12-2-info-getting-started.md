# Gettting started - if you could hire me that would Great! 
    So lets be honnest, getting started is a bit of misnomer. 
    why is that you ask well everyone wants to go directly into infosec and while that might be awesome and trust me
    its a great feeling when you finally "Make it!" but really if you want to do well in information security you have
    to be in love with the feild otherwise you'll just end up brunt out!
