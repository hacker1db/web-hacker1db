# Incident Response Playbook: Lessons from Real Cyber Attacks

After responding to dozens of security incidents‚Äîfrom ransomware attacks to APT campaigns‚ÄîI've learned that good incident response isn't just about having the right tools. It's about having the right processes, mindset, and ability to stay calm under pressure.

## The Reality of Incident Response

### The First 30 Minutes Are Critical

When the SOC calls you at 3 AM with "We think we have a breach," what you do in the next 30 minutes often determines whether you're dealing with a minor incident or a company-ending catastrophe.

Here's my battle-tested approach:

```bash
# Immediate triage script I keep ready
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== INCIDENT RESPONSE TRIAGE ==="
echo "Time: $(date)"
echo "Analyst: $USER"

# Quick system status
echo -e "\n=== SYSTEM STATUS ==="
uptime
df -h
free -m

# Check for obvious signs of compromise
echo -e "\n=== PROCESS ANALYSIS ==="
ps aux | grep -E "(crypto|miner|xmrig|monero)" | grep -v grep
netstat -tulpn | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l

# Check recent logins
echo -e "\n=== RECENT LOGINS ==="
last | head -10

# Look for new files in common attack locations
echo -e "\n=== RECENT FILE CHANGES ==="
find /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm -type f -mtime -1 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

## The NIST Framework in Practice

### Preparation: Building Your Arsenal

Don't wait for an incident to start building your toolkit. Here's what I keep ready:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Incident Response Toolkit
Quick deployment script for IR tools
"""
import subprocess
import os
import sys

class IRToolkit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {
            'volatility': 'Memory analysis',
            'plaso': 'Timeline analysis', 
            'bulk_extractor': 'Evidence extraction',
            'sleuthkit': 'File system analysis',
            'yara': 'Malware detection',
            'clamav': 'Antivirus scanning'
        }
    
    def deploy_tools(self):
        """Deploy essential IR tools quickly"""
        print("üöÄ Deploying Incident Response Toolkit...")
        
        for tool, description in self.tools.items():
            if self.is_tool_available(tool):
                print(f"‚úÖ {tool} - {description}")
            else:
                print(f"‚ùå {tool} - Installing...")
                self.install_tool(tool)
    
    def is_tool_available(self, tool):
        return subprocess.call(['which', tool], 
                             stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, 
                             stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL) == 0
    
    def install_tool(self, tool):
        install_commands = {
            'volatility': 'pip3 install volatility3',
            'plaso': 'apt-get install -y plaso-tools',
            'bulk_extractor': 'apt-get install -y bulk-extractor',

            'clamav': 'apt-get install -y clamav clamav-daemon'
        }
        
        if tool in install_commands:
            subprocess.run(install_commands[tool], shell=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    toolkit = IRToolkit()
    toolkit.deploy_tools()
```

### Detection and Analysis: Finding the Needle

#### Memory Analysis Workflow

When you suspect active malware, memory is your best friend:

```bash
# Memory acquisition and analysis workflow
# 1. Acquire memory dump
sudo dd if=/dev/mem of=/case/memory.dump bs=1M

# 2. Identify the profile
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump windows.info

# 3. Hunt for malicious processes
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.pslist
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.pstree

# 4. Check network connections
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.netscan

# 5. Look for code injection
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.malfind
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.hollowfind

# 6. Extract suspicious processes
vol.py -f /case/memory.dump --profile=Win10x64_19041 windows.memmap --pid 1234 --dump-dir /case/extracted/
```

#### Log Analysis Automation

Time is critical during incidents. Here's my log analysis automation:

```python
import re
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from collections import Counter

class LogAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        self.log_file = log_file
        self.suspicious_patterns = {
            'sql_injection': r'(union|select|drop|insert|update|delete).*from',
            'xss_attempt': r'<script|javascript:|vbscript:|onload|onerror',
            'directory_traversal': r'\.\.[\\/]',
            'command_injection': r'[;&|`]\s*(cat|ls|pwd|whoami|id|uname)',
            'brute_force': r'(401|403|failed)',
        }
    
    def analyze_timeframe(self, hours_back=24):
        """Analyze logs for the last N hours"""
        cutoff_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=hours_back)
        suspicious_events = []
        
        with open(self.log_file, 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                event = self.parse_log_line(line)
                if event and event['timestamp'] > cutoff_time:
                    threats = self.check_threats(event['message'])
                    if threats:
                        event['threats'] = threats
                        suspicious_events.append(event)
        
        return suspicious_events
    
    def parse_log_line(self, line):
        """Parse common log formats"""
        # Apache/Nginx combined log format
        pattern = r'(\S+) \S+ \S+ \[([\w:/]+\s[+\-]\d{4})\] "(\S+) (\S+) (\S+)" (\d{3}) (\d+|-) "([^"]*)" "([^"]*)"'
        match = re.match(pattern, line)
        
        if match:
            return {
                'ip': match.group(1),
                'timestamp': datetime.strptime(match.group(2), '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z'),

                'size': match.group(7),
                'referer': match.group(8),
                'user_agent': match.group(9),
                'message': line
            }
        return None

### Containment: Stop the Bleeding

#### Network Isolation Script

When you need to isolate a compromised system quickly:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency network isolation script
# Usage: ./isolate.sh <hostname_or_ip>

TARGET=$1
ISOLATION_VLAN=999  # Quarantine VLAN

if [ -z "$TARGET" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <hostname_or_ip>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "üö® EMERGENCY ISOLATION INITIATED FOR: $TARGET"
echo "Time: $(date)"

# Log the isolation action
echo "$(date) - ISOLATION: $TARGET isolated by $USER" >> /var/log/incident-response.log

# Method 1: Switch-based isolation (if you have management access)
isolate_via_switch() {
    echo "Attempting switch-based isolation..."
    
    # Find switch port (this varies by network infrastructure)
    MAC=$(arp -n $TARGET | awk '{print $3}')
    
    if [ ! -z "$MAC" ]; then
        echo "MAC Address found: $MAC"
        
        # SNMP commands to move port to quarantine VLAN
        # (Replace with your actual switch management commands)
        snmpset -v2c -c private $SWITCH_IP 1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.5.1.1.$PORT i $ISOLATION_VLAN
        echo "‚úÖ Moved $TARGET to quarantine VLAN $ISOLATION_VLAN"
    fi
}

# Method 2: Firewall rule isolation
isolate_via_firewall() {
    echo "Creating firewall isolation rules..."
    
    # Block all traffic to/from the target
    iptables -I FORWARD -s $TARGET -j DROP
    iptables -I FORWARD -d $TARGET -j DROP
    
    # Allow only essential management traffic
    iptables -I FORWARD -s $TARGET -d $MANAGEMENT_SUBNET -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
    
    echo "‚úÖ Firewall isolation rules applied"
}

# Method 3: DNS blackhole (for malware C2 communication)
isolate_dns() {
    echo "Implementing DNS isolation..."
    
    # Add to DNS blackhole zone
    echo "$TARGET" >> /etc/bind/blackhole.zone
    systemctl reload bind9
    
    echo "‚úÖ DNS blackhole updated"
}

# Execute isolation methods
isolate_via_firewall
isolate_dns

# Notify incident response team
echo "üìß Notifying incident response team..."
echo "URGENT: System $TARGET has been isolated due to security incident. Isolation completed at $(date)" | \
    mail -s "SECURITY INCIDENT: System Isolated" ir-team@company.com

echo "üîí Isolation complete. System $TARGET is quarantined."
echo "üìã Next steps:"
echo "  1. Preserve system for forensic analysis"
echo "  2. Begin malware analysis"
echo "  3. Check for lateral movement"
echo "  4. Update incident documentation"
```

## Case Study: Ransomware Response

### The 2 AM Call

Last year, our monitoring system detected file encryption activity across multiple servers. Here's how we responded:

#### Initial Detection

```bash
# The alert that woke me up:
# "High volume of file modifications detected across 15 servers"

# First response - check what's happening
for server in $(cat affected_servers.txt); do
    echo "Checking $server..."
    ssh $server "find /home /opt /var -name '*.locked' -o -name '*.encrypted' | wc -l"
done

# Output showed hundreds of encrypted files - definitely ransomware
```

#### Immediate Actions

1. **Document everything** - Started incident log immediately
2. **Isolate affected systems** - Used automated isolation script
3. **Preserve evidence** - Created disk images of key systems
4. **Activate incident response team** - Called in the cavalry

#### Investigation Timeline

```python
# Timeline reconstruction script
import json
from datetime import datetime

timeline_events = [
    {
        "time": "2023-11-15 01:47:22",
        "source": "SIEM",
        "event": "Unusual PowerShell execution detected on WEB01",
        "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
        "time": "2023-11-15 01:52:11", 
        "source": "EDR",
        "event": "Suspicious process tree: powershell.exe -> cmd.exe -> cipher.exe",
        "severity": "high"
    },
    {
        "time": "2023-11-15 02:15:33",
        "source": "File Monitor", 
        "event": "Mass file encryption started on FILE01",
        "severity": "critical"
    },
    {
        "time": "2023-11-15 02:17:45",
        "source": "Network Monitor",
        "event": "Outbound connection to known C2 server 185.159.157.13",
        "severity": "critical"
    }
]

# Analysis showed the attack progression:
# 1. Initial compromise via phishing email
# 2. PowerShell-based reconnaissance 
# 3. Credential theft using Mimikatz
# 4. Lateral movement to file servers
# 5. Ransomware deployment across network
```

### Recovery and Lessons Learned

#### What Worked
- **Automated isolation** limited the blast radius
- **Offline backups** enabled complete recovery
- **Incident response playbook** kept team focused
- **Regular tabletop exercises** prepared the team

#### What Could Have Been Better
- **Earlier detection** - initial compromise went unnoticed for 6 hours
- **Better segmentation** - lateral movement was too easy
- **Faster communication** - took too long to notify leadership

## Measuring Incident Response Effectiveness

### Key Metrics to Track

```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
    
    def calculate_mttr(self, incidents):
        """Mean Time to Recovery"""
        total_time = sum([
            (incident['resolved_time'] - incident['detected_time']).total_seconds()
            for incident in incidents if incident['resolved_time']
        ])
        return total_time / len(incidents) / 3600  # Hours
    
    def calculate_mttd(self, incidents):
        """Mean Time to Detection"""
        total_time = sum([
            (incident['detected_time'] - incident['occurred_time']).total_seconds()
            for incident in incidents if incident['occurred_time']
        ])
        return total_time / len(incidents) / 3600  # Hours
    
    def calculate_containment_time(self, incidents):
        """Average time to contain incidents"""
        total_time = sum([
            (incident['contained_time'] - incident['detected_time']).total_seconds()
            for incident in incidents if incident['contained_time']
        ])
        return total_time / len(incidents) / 60  # Minutes
```

## Wrapping Up

Effective incident response isn't about having perfect tools or processes‚Äîit's about being prepared, staying calm under pressure, and learning from every incident.

### Key Success Factors

1. **Preparation beats perfection** - Have playbooks ready
2. **Speed matters** - First 30 minutes are critical
3. **Document everything** - Evidence and decisions
4. **Communicate clearly** - Keep stakeholders informed
5. **Learn and improve** - Every incident teaches something

### Building Your IR Capability

Start with these foundational elements:

- **Written playbooks** for common scenarios
- **Automated tools** for evidence collection
- **Communication templates** for different audiences
- **Regular exercises** to test your response
- **Continuous improvement** based on lessons learned

Remember: The best incident response is the one you never have to use because your prevention worked. But when prevention fails, having a solid IR capability can mean the difference between a minor incident and a company-ending breach.
